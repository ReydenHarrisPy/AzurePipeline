# AzurePipeline
Azure dataprocessing pipeline with databricks

I created this pipeline for my Distributed databases class

The scope of the project is as a data engineer for the governing body of medical data, I want to transform and load the data file from the Vermont Board of Licensing into only import into our database the relevant information.  From there We will have the ability to create visualizations by employing the PowerBI application to connect to our Azure SQL database. We will also have databricks integration throughout the  project to facilitate spark processing and be able to run machine learning algorithms in this environment.
